# dynamic-model-simulation
Matlab simulation for Systems Design Engineering 351, Systems Models, project. This code outputs data points simulating the oscillation of a rotating cylinder. The rotation of the cylinder is forced clockwise by an anchored elastic, and counter-clockwise by a hanging mass that changes value with height (a chain that lowers on to the ground).
